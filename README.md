The Clone a remote GIT repository. window is displayed.

Select either Use HTTPS or Use SSH.

Type in the Repository URL, and choose an empty Check out directory.

Select Use Credentials / Use Key and configure authentication (either sign in with GitHub, enter user and password, enter user and token for HTTPS, or enter private key path and password for SSH).

Click Open, Studio opens the project in the Designer panel.

In the Open window, select a project.json file to open in Studio.

After cloning a GIT repository to a local working directory, the .git subdirectory is created containing the necessary GIT metadata. The metadata includes subdirectories for objects, refs, and template files. In addition, a HEAD file is also created, which points to the currently checked out commit.
